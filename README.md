# Decision-Tree-Iris-Dataset
A Decision Tree classification project using the Iris dataset. This R script applies a Decision Tree algorithm using the rpart package to classify iris species, and visualizes the tree structure using rpart.plot.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use the Decision Tree algorithm to classify iris species based on sepal and petal measurements. The model is trained on a subset of the Iris dataset, and the resulting tree is visualized using the `rpart.plot` package.

## Libraries Required
- rpart
- rpart.plot

## Instructions to Run
1. Install necessary packages:
   ```R
   install.packages("rpart")
   install.packages("rpart.plot")
